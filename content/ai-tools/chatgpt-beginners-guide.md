## Best Practices for Using ChatGPT

### Do's

✅ **Be specific** in your requests  
✅ **Provide context** for better results  
✅ **Iterate and refine** your prompts  
✅ **Fact-check** important information  
✅ **Use it as a starting point**, not final product  
✅ **Experiment** with different approaches

### Don'ts

❌ **Don't share sensitive** personal information  
❌ **Don't rely on it** for medical/legal advice  
❌ **Don't assume** all information is accurate  
❌ **Don't use it** to create misleading content  
❌ **Don't plagiarize** - always add your own voice

## Advanced Tips and Tricks

### 1. Chain Prompts

Break complex tasks into steps:

```
Step 1: "Create an outline for [topic]"
Step 2: "Expand section 1 of the outline"
Step 3: "Now expand section 2..."
```

### 2. Role-Playing

Ask ChatGPT to assume specific roles:

- "Act as a career counselor..."

- "You are an expert accountant..."

### 3. Format Specifications

Request specific formats:

- "Provide the answer as a bullet list"

### 4. Iterative Refinement

Don't settle for the first response:

- "Make it more concise"
- "Add more examples"
- "Simplify the language"
- "Make it more professional"

## Common Limitations to Know

### What ChatGPT Can't Do

1. **Access real-time information** (knowledge cutoff date)
2. **Browse the internet** (in free version)
3. **Remember past conversations** (unless in same chat)
4. **Provide guaranteed accuracy** (always verify)
5. **Replace human judgment** (use as a tool, not replacement)

If ChatGPT makes a mistake:

- Point it out: "That information seems incorrect"

- Rephrase your question
- Try a different approach

## Productivity Workflows
